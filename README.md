# Binary LLDs for Cross Compilation Purposes

The [LLVM](https://llvm.org) linker, binaries for Homebrew consumption. 
Would be better to build from source, but that requires `llvm-config`.
PRs are very welcome.

The included binaries are prebuilt LLVM.org provides binaries, 
as available in those larger tarballs (including all of CLang/LLVM for Darwin):
